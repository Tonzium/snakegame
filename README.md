## üß† Game Logic Overview

### Player Snake
- Moves one grid cell per frame in the current direction.
- Controlled via keyboard (`WASD` / arrow keys) or on-screen buttons.
- Grows by one cell when consuming a reward.
- Loses if it collides with itself, a wall, or the AI snake.

### AI Snake
- Evaluates four possible directions every frame.
- Avoids moving into:
  - Its own body
  - The player‚Äôs body
  - The grid boundaries
- Chooses the direction minimizing **Manhattan distance** to the reward.

### Reward Generation
- The reward appears at a random location not occupied by either snake.
- When eaten, it respawns in another valid position.
